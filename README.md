# Solid Slime
👾 A 2D, pixel art, **platforming** experience which plays a major twist on the idea of platforming, as you can *become* the platform. Freeze your character in mid-air to create your *own* path to completion! 

💡 This game was made by me during the recovery period of a orthodontic surgery, meaning that I was taking lots of post-surgery medicine. Hopefully this adds to your enjoyment of the game...
